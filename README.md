# project-intake

Web developer specializing in Laravel, focused on building reliable, efficient, and scalable web applications with a clean and transparent approach.
I accept web development projects with a clear and transparent workflow.

**My workflow:**  
Receive project from client → Work on the project until completion → Provide a demo (via ngrok) → Client approves and makes payment → Deliver the source code → Project completed.

This process ensures clarity and trust from start to finish. If a project is canceled or payment is not completed after delivery, the work may be added to my personal portfolio. I prioritize quality, transparency, and security in every project.

**Disclaimer:**  
I operate under a pseudonymous identity for the convenience of all parties involved.
